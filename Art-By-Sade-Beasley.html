<h1> Art By Sade Beasley </h1>

<p> Welcome to my webpage, Art by Sade Beasley! </p>
<p> This page tells you a little about who I am and showcase some of my original paintings. </p>

<h4> About Me </h4>

<p> My name is Sade Beasley and I enjoy painting. When I was really young, my father would create sketches that made me want to start drawing as well. Throughout my childhood my 5th grade teacher refined my doodles as an art mentor, I created and sold artwork throughout the Alberta community in Portland, and have created a mural in the Lloyd district.</p>

<p> Other than painting and surrounding myself with artwork, I am a Sophomore student at Portland State University studying Computer Science. I am also a student at Epicodus. I enjoy being able to have so many interests and a love to learn new things.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading about me!</p>
